    <h2> Walter Camp</h2>
    <p>
      On April 7, 1859, Walter Chauncey Camp, the ‘Father of American football,’ was born in New Britain, Connecticut. Camp was a gifted athlete who participated in baseball, crew, swimming, tennis, and track. He excelled at football, however, and played for Yale for six years–four as an undergraduate and two as a medical student. Remarkably, Walter Camp was captain of both the freshman baseball and football teams, a testament to his athleticism. He later developed the “Daily Dozen,” a series of exercises for physical fitness used to train servicemen in World War I. Walter Camp is credited with altering the rules of rugby to create the game of modern North American football we are familiar with today. The line of scrimmage, use of downs, point system, the number of players per side, and the creation of the quarterback position all stemmed from Walter Camp’s influence. One of the highest-paid nonfiction writers of the time, Camp is also credited with the “long-term commercialization” of the sport, having written hundreds of articles and dozens of books extolling the virtues of football. In 1928 Yale erected a monument to Camp’s contribution, the Walter Camp Memorial Gateway at the Yale Bowl.

  <h2> John Hesimen</h2>
  <p>
    John Heisman was a college football coach for three decades in the late 1800’s and early 1900’s, including five seasons as head coach at Auburn University from 1895-1899. Heisman never had losing season at Auburn, posting a combined record of 12-4-2 with the Tigers. He coached at a number of other schools, including Clemson, Georgia Tech, Penn and Rice, and was 186-70-18 for his career as a head coach. Heisman was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1954 and the Heisman Trophy was originally named in his honor. He passed away in 1936 at the age of 66. During his coaching career, Heisman changed the face of the game that became America’s passion. What he considered his greatest contribution, the forward pass, was legalized in 1906, after three years of writing and pestering Walter Camp and the rules committee. Much of the official rule book of the day adopted Heisman’s suggestions word for word. Additionaly, Heismen is credited with inventing the hidden ball trick and popularizing the use of hike to snap the ball.

  <h2> Amos Alonso Stagg </h2>
  <p>
    Considered one of the great innovators in the development of college football, Amos Alonzo Stagg served as head football coach at the University of Chicago from 1892 to 1932. During his tenure, Stagg compiled a record of 227-112-26 and led the Maroons to seven Big Ten Conference championships (1899, 1905, 1907, 1908, 1913, 1922, 1924). Under Stagg's guidance, UChicago emerged as one of the nation's most formidable football powers during the first quarter of the 20th century. In addition to his football duties, Stagg coached track for 32 years, baseball for 19 years, and basketball for one season. He helped to organize the Big Ten Conference (then known as the Western Conference) and was one of the founders of the American Football Coaches Association (AFCA).Among the innovations credited to Stagg are the tackling dummy, the huddle, the reverse and man in motion plays, the lateral pass, uniform numbers, and awarding varsity letters.

    <h2> Fielding H. Yost </h2>
  <p>
    In his 25 years as head coach of the Wolverines, Yost's accomplishments rank among the most legendary in collegiate football history. Beginning with his inaugural club of 1901, Yost led the Michigan football program on an unprecedented victory run over a five year period. Known as the "Point-a-Minute" teams, those Yost led squads played 56 consecutive games without a loss from 1901-1905, which remains the longest winning streaks in school history In those five season the Wolverines outscored their opponents 2,821 to 42 an averagee Michigan victory of 50-1. In his first season, 1901, Yost led the Wolverines to a perfect 10-0 record, a Big Ten Championship, a 49-0 victory over Stanford in the the First Rose Bowl game and the school's firt national championshiop. The Wolverines went on to win the national title again in 1902, 1903, and 1904. Under Yost, the maize and blue won ten Big Ten championships and 20 of his players earned AllAmerican recognition. Along with his accomplishments as the head football coach, Yost served as Michigan's Director of Athletics from 1921-41. For his leadership of the athletic department, Yost is viewed by many as the consummate pioneer and visionary of the field. As athletic director, Yost continued Michigan's tradition of accepting only the highest personal, academic, and athletic standards, while spreading that ideal to the facilities which support Michigan's athletic pursuits. Yost conceived and engineered today's modem athletic campus in Ann Arbor. Among the projects constructed under Yost's direction were Michigan Stadium, the university's 18-hole golf course, the nation's first Intramural Sports Building and the nation's first multi-purpose field house-now known as Yost Ice Arena. Beyond all his accomplishment at UofM Yost is credited with inventing the hurry up concept, the concept of being a professional coach and having argubably the largest coaching tree of all time with 77 former players or assistants becoming collegiate head coaches.

  <h2> Pop Warner</h2>
  <p>
    Glenn Scobey Warner (April 5, 1871 – September 7, 1954), most commonly known as Pop Warner, was an American college football coach at various institutions who is responsible for several key aspects of the modern game. Included among his innovations are the single and double wing formations (precursors of the modern spread and shotgun formations), the three point stance and the body blocking technique. Fellow pioneer coach Amos Alonzo Stagg called Warner "one of the excellent creators". He was inducted as a coach into the College Football Hall of Fame as part of its inaugural class in 1951. He also contributed to a junior football program which became known as Pop Warner Little Scholars, a popular youth American football organization. In the early 1900s, he created a premier football program at the Carlisle Indian Industrial School—a federally-funded, off-reservation Indian boarding school. He also coached teams to four national championships: Pittsburgh in 1915, 1916, and 1918 and Stanford in 1926. In all, he was head coach at the University of Georgia (1895–1896), Iowa Agricultural College and Model Farm (1895–1899), Cornell University (1897–1898 and 1904–1906), Carlisle (1899–1903 and 1907–1914), Pittsburgh (1915–1923), Stanford (1924–1932) and Temple University (1933–1938), compiling a career college football record of 319–106–32. Predating Bear Bryant, Eddie Robinson, and Joe Paterno, he once had the most wins of any coach in college football history.
